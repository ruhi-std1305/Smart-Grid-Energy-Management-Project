# Smart-Grid-Energy-Management-Project 

A C++ console-based group project created to demonstrate problem-solving using three important algorithmic approaches: **Dynamic Programming**, **Divide and Conquer**, and **Greedy Algorithms**.  
These methods are applied to real-world smart grid energy management problems such as demand prediction, energy distribution, and maintenance scheduling.  
This project was developed as part of a course assignment and may be extended in the future with additional features.
